# rm-pad

This is a simple program that takes input from a reMarkable tablet (only for rm2 right now, might work on rmpp too but untested) and converts it into libinput devices. This project only works on linux, and is only tested on wayland.

Features:
- Pen input (position, pressure and tilt)
- Touch input (multi-touch gestures, tapping and moving)
- Configurable palm rejection (disables touch input for a configurable grace period if any pen input is detected, default 500ms)
- Screen orientation support (portrait, landscape-right, landscape-left, inverted)
- Input grab (enabled by default): A small helper binary is uploaded to `/tmp` on the tablet and uses `EVIOCGRAB` to exclusively grab the input devices. The tablet UI (xochitl) keeps running but receives no pen/touch events. The grab is automatically released when rm-pad exits or the SSH connection drops — no reboot or manual cleanup needed. Use `--no-grab-input` to disable.
- Works over both wifi and USB
- Very low latency (as long as your connection to the tablet is fast)
- Runs in userspace (as long as your user is allowed to create input devices)
- Debug mode: `rm-pad dump touch` or `rm-pad dump pen` to dump raw input events

## Installation

Either build it yourself, use the prebuilt binaries from GitHub releases.

### Arch Linux

I haven't added this to the AUR yet, but I've created a PKGBUILD, so you can install it easily on arch:

```
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/rm-pad.git
cd rm-pad
makepkg -si
```

The package includes a udev rule for uinput access and a systemd user service. After installation, follow the setup instructions below.

### Nix

A flake is provided with a dev shell and a build-from-source package:

```bash
# Development shell (Rust toolchain + ARM cross-compilers + native deps).
# Or run `direnv allow` to load it automatically via the bundled .envrc.
nix develop

# Build/run from source:
nix run .#rm-pad -- --help
```

### Building from source

You'll need Rust and C cross-compilers for ARM:

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu
```

**Arch Linux:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc
```

You can also set `ARMV7_CC` and `AARCH64_CC` environment variables to point to your cross-compilers.

Then build with:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Setup

#### SSH Authentication

For passwordless SSH access, copy your SSH key to the tablet:

```bash
ssh-copy-id root@10.11.99.1
```

If connecting over WiFi, replace `10.11.99.1` with your tablet's IP address. The default password is usually `root` (or check your reMarkable documentation).

#### Udev Rules (required for userspace operation)

To allow rm-pad to create virtual input devices, you need to set up udev rules:

```bash
sudo cp data/50-uinput.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo groupadd -f uinput
sudo usermod -aG uinput $USER
```

Then log out and back in (or reboot), and reload udev rules:
```bash
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

#### Systemd Service (optional, for automatic startup)

rm-pad can run as a persistent user service that automatically reconnects whenever the tablet becomes reachable:

1. Install the systemd service:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp data/rm-pad.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
```

2. Enable and start the service:
```bash
systemctl --user enable --now rm-pad.service
```

The service runs in the background and handles connection/disconnection automatically — just plug in your tablet and it starts forwarding input. When you unplug, it detects the disconnection and waits for the next connection.

> This defaults to only running when connected over USB. You can modify the service file if you want it to work over wifi, but then you can't use your remarkable while on wifi and the experience is often subpar over a wireless connection.

## Configuration

Config file search order:
1. `RMPAD_CONFIG` environment variable (if set)
2. `./rm-pad.toml` (current directory)
3. `~/.config/rm-pad.toml` (user config directory)

Copy the `rm-pad.toml.example` file to one of these locations (recommended: `~/.config/rm-pad.toml`) and change the options to your preferences.

### Connection settings

- **host**: reMarkable tablet IP address or hostname. Default is `10.11.99.1` (USB connection). For WiFi, use your tablet's IP address.
- **key_path**: Path to SSH private key for authentication. Defaults to your default SSH key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`, `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, etc.). Only used if `password` is not set.
- **password**: Root password for SSH authentication. If set, `key_path` is ignored. **Warning**: Restrict file permissions with `chmod 600` if storing password in config file.

You can also use environment variables:
- `RMPAD_HOST`: Override host
- `RMPAD_PASSWORD`: Override password
- `RMPAD_CONFIG`: Override config file path

### Behavior options

- **touch_only**: Run touch input only (no pen)
- **pen_only**: Run pen input only (no touch)
- **grab_input**: Grab input exclusively (prevents tablet UI from seeing input, default: `true`)
- **no_palm_rejection**: Disable palm rejection
- **palm_grace_ms**: Palm rejection grace period in milliseconds (default: 500)
- **orientation**: Screen orientation - `portrait`, `landscape-right` (default), `landscape-left`, or `inverted`

All options can also be set via command-line flags. Run `rm-pad --help` for details.

## Usage

Run `rm-pad` to start forwarding input. The program will automatically reconnect if the connection drops.

For debugging, use the dump command:
```bash
rm-pad dump touch  # Dump raw touch events
rm-pad dump pen    # Dump raw pen events
```

## Disclaimer

This is software I've wanted myself, and this is in large part AI generated. Initially I wanted to just build a POC, but it turned out well enough to where I don't see the need to rewrite it
